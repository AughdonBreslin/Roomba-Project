# Roomba-Project
Controlling a Roomba using game controller and tilt controls! Done with Sal Montero aka inlineskater720

Hello!

This project was done during highschool in my Advanced Topics Class, and using my personal Roomba I had brought into school, Sal and I learned how to attach an Arduino and Bluetooth module into the Roomba's serial ports, upload code into the Arduino, and then run controls from an Android phone I borrowed from a classmate. We got the Roomba working remote controlled firstly through a PS3-like controller, simulated with an Android app. 

Then we controlled it using threshold values on the phone's built-in gyroscope. Assume rotational terms with a plane, mapped to a phone: Holding the phone horizontally, when the phone was pitched forward x amount, the roomba would drive forward. When the phone was rolled y amount, the roomba would turn left or right. 

This was a really fun project to test in the classroom as we could drive the roomba around as we gained better access to its movements, and annoy our classmates as we programmed the tunes for the roomba to play through a long series of notes.
